here we notice that each row of the "Make your choice" table is an html form element,
the form action is set to '#' which is self, and the form method is set to 'post'

form has several inputs:
    name="sujet", input type="hidden", value range from 2 .. 6
    name="valeur", input type="select", value range from 1 .. 10

the "valeur" element has a `onchange` attribute, javascript which submits the form

if we submit a post request where the `valeur` is greater than 10, the page shows the flag:

The flag is 03a944b434d5baff05f46c4bede5792551a2595574bcafc9a6e25f67c382ccaa

moral of the story:
when variables are passed in the url (html get request) it is very simple to change them directly in the browser,
with a post request its slightly more complex but can still lead to undesired behavior, so user data must be sanitized/validated
